## 🗺️ The Path of Configuration

### Enchanting Your Environment

You must bind these mystical environment variables to your shell configuration (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or Windows Environment Variables):

```bash
# The location of your Android SDK
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk  # Adjust path as needed

# The location of your Android NDK
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/[version]  # Replace [version] with your NDK version
```

## 🎯 The Compilation Ritual

1. **Clone the Sacred Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd [repository-directory]
   ```

2. **Invoke the Build Script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x zork.sh
   ./zork.sh
   ```

3. **Enter the Castle Directory**
   ```bash
   cd zork
   ```

4. **Summon the APK**
   - For a debug build:
     ```bash
     gradle assembleDebug
     ```
   - For a release build:
     ```bash
     gradle assembleRelease or gradle assemble
     ```

5. **Locate Your Treasure**
   The mythical APK will materialize in:
   ```
   app/build/outputs/apk/debug/zork.apk (relase directory if using release)
